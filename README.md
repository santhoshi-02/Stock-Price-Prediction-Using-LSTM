# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM
In this notebook, we will discover and explore data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft). We will learn how to use past and present finance data to get stock information, and visualize different aspects of it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method!
